# Name:    Dockerfile
# Purpose: Build a developer image of Kythe.
# Author:  M. J. Fromberger <michael.j.fromberger@gmail.com>

FROM creachadair/bazelbox AS build
#
# Install the external dependencies of Kythe.
# See: https://kythe.io/getting-started/
#
# Additions: arcanist, cmake, golint, jq, make, patch, sudo, zip
# Changes:   clang 3.8 â†’ clang-4.0
#
# Go is described as a requirement, but Bazel pulls in a Go toolchain on its
# own so you can do without it. Similarly jq is not required to build, but is
# very helpful for munging output data from the tools.
